# Finclutech Frontend  

Finclutech is a dynamic financial services platform designed to handle service management, dynamic form generation, and user entry tracking. Built with React and leveraging Redux for state management, this project features a modular architecture that ensures scalability, maintainability, and a seamless developer experience.  

## 🚀 Overview  

This application is engineered to:  
- Dynamically render forms based on service configurations fetched from the backend.  
- Validate user inputs dynamically and store submissions securely in the database.  
- Provide a dashboard with key metrics and data visualizations for actionable insights.  
- Enable user management and entry tracking for better organization and operational efficiency.

## 🏗️ Architecture  

### **Core Architecture**  
The project is built using a feature-based architecture that organizes files and code into logical modules for easier management and scalability.  

### **Data Flow**  
1. **API Calls**: Fetch services, field configurations, and entries dynamically from the backend.  
2. **Redux Slices**: Manage the application state centrally to handle services, forms, and user entries.  
3. **Components & Pages**: Render dynamic forms, tables, and dashboards for a user-friendly interface.

## 🔧 Tech Stack  

### **Frontend**  
- **React 18**: Component library for dynamic UI development.  
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management to handle application data efficiently.  
- **TailwindCSS**: Modern utility-first CSS framework for styling.  
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication.  
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions.  

### **Backend**  
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for server-side development.  
- **Express.js**: Framework for building APIs and handling requests.  
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing services and user entries.  
- **JWT**: Secure authentication mechanism.

## 🔨 Setup Instructions  

### **1. Install Dependencies**  
```bash
npm install
```  

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**  
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:  
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-backend-api-url
REACT_APP_AUTH_TOKEN=your-jwt-token
```  

### **3. Run the Application**  
Start the development server:  
```bash
npm start
```  

### **4. Backend API Requirements**  
Ensure the backend API is running with the following capabilities:  
- Service configuration endpoints.  
- Data submission and retrieval endpoints.  

---

## 🔗 API Endpoints  

### **Service and Form APIs**  
1. **GET `/api/services`**  
   - Fetches a list of services with their field configurations.  

2. **POST `/api/services/:id/submit`**  
   - Submits form data for a specific service.  

3. **GET `/api/services/:id/entries`**  
   - Retrieves entries for a specific service with support for filtering and pagination.  

---

## 📊 Key Features  

### 1. **Dynamic Form Rendering**  
- Fetch and render forms based on service configurations.  
- Support for field types: number, text, dropdown (option), and date.  
- Real-time form validation using regex and other rules.  

### 2. **Entry Management**  
- List all entries for a specific service with filtering and sorting.  
- Paginated results for better navigation.  
- Detailed view of each entry.  

### 3. **Dashboard and Reporting**  
- Visualize key metrics such as:  
  - Total count of entries per service.  
  - Trends over time (e.g., daily/weekly submissions).  
  - Frequently used services.  
- Interactive charts and summary cards.
